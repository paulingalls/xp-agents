Split out of spawn_teammate.py to keep that file under the 500-line cap. Owns
the allowed-tools list and the model/plugin-dir/effort flag wiring; imported

    """Construct the claude -p command for a teammate.

    Prompt is piped via stdin, not passed as a CLI flag. When *model* is
    given, a --model flag selects the teammate's tier (e.g. sonnet for a
    delegated solo teammate); otherwise the claude -p default is inherited.

    When *plugin_dir* is given, a --plugin-dir flag loads that plugin into the
    headless teammate session. This is REQUIRED for the teammate to get the
    xp-agents skills, agents, and hooks: a worktree `claude -p` session does
    not apply the project-scoped marketplace enablement, so without
    --plugin-dir the plugin (and its full hook lifecycle) never loads.

    When *effort* is given, a --effort flag forwards the reasoning-effort
    level — but only when the resolved *model* is known to support it
    (tier_wire.effort_supported). Support is non-uniform across tiers (the
    cheapest tier rejects effort outright), so an unsupported model+effort
    pair is dropped with a stderr note rather than erroring the spawn: it
    fail-safes to the model default. When *model* is None the resolved tier
    is inherited from the orchestrator and unknown here, so effort is treated
    as unverifiable and dropped — never forward a param we can't confirm.
